<p>The RuneScape Rules of Conduct are listed below. The titles and summaries give a good sense of what each entails, and mostly it's just common sense. However, further detail is found in each section, should you need it.</p>
<p>The Ignore List allows you to avoid individual players with whom you do not wish to interact. However, should you encounter another player presenting a serious risk to yourself or other players, or maliciously undermining your game experience, the Report Abuse feature allows you to escalate these problems directly to us.</p></div>

	<h2 class="double-title" style="font-size:3em;"><a name="macroing"></a>Macroing and third-party software</h2>
	<div style="border: 2px solid black;outline: 1px solid #62686c;box-shadow:0px 0px 10px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.7);padding: 10px;background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7);margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 40px;">
		<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Software that can be used to gain an unfair advantage in our games may not be used. This includes automation tools, macros, bots, auto-typers, and tools that circumvent any of our mechanisms designed to automatically log out inactive users.</p>
		<p>Any game-specific, third-party software that encourages contradiction of the previous statement, bypasses the normal navigation of our website, automatically requests pages from our website or which endangers user accounts are also regarded as detrimental to RuneScape and should not be used.</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Why we have this rule</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Many third party software websites and applications contain keyloggers, trojans and viruses which will put players' personal details at risk. Macroing also gives some players an unfair advantage and can detract from the experience of RuneScape. We designed this game to be enjoyed by humans- not robots!</p>
	<h4>Types of disallowed third-party software</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Software that attempts to communicate directly with our game worlds.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Software that monitors, modifies or decrypts the communications between our game applets and our game worlds.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Software that generates input to our game applets. This includes software that automatically moves the mouse pointer or generates mouse clicks or key presses.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Modified or replacement versions of our game applets. Reverse-engineering our game applets is strictly prohibited. Using a modified version of our game applets is not permitted for any reason. Third-party software that displays pages/content from our website(s), and that has specific features (i.e. toolkits) must not be used to access our website unless that software conforms with all of the other rules, and the following additional rules:</p>
	<ul style="font-size: 1.5em;list-style-type: disc;padding-left: 20px;line-height: 1.5em; padding-bottom: 15px;">
		<li>It must not encourage rule-breaking or endanger users.</li>
		<li>It must not contain adverts or links to websites that encourage rule-breaking or endanger users.</li>
		<li>It must not automatically make repeated page/content requests from our website or otherwise make excessively bandwidth-intensive requests from our servers (each page/content request should only be in direct response to a user request each time).</li>
		<li>It must not bypass the normal navigation of our website for users wishing to reach the game worlds. The software should initially only point at the front page of our websites, and should require the user to navigate through the website normally to reach the game worlds. The software must not contain or acquire direct links to the game applet.</li>
		<li>It must not hide or encourage the hiding of any of the adverts on our website. To avoid encouraging users to hide the advert above the game, the pane displaying pages from our website must default to at least 630 pixels high (if viewed on a screen with a resolution higher than 800x600), and it must not be possible to resize it to less height than that, i.e. the page must be displayed in such a way that both the game and advert are fully visible at the same time.</li>
		<li>It must not attempt to make it easier to enter a busy game world than it would be for users not using the software. It must not contain any features to make it easier to enter or monitor busy worlds.</li>
		<li>If the software has its own integrated chat feature, separate from the game chat, it should make it very clear to users that this chat is not part of our games and is not official, endorsed, or moderated by Jagex in any way. Furthermore, this chat should still be moderated (just not by us), and the moderators should not allow chat which infringes our Rules of Conduct. To avoid confusion with the official game chat, moderators of the external chat should not be indicated with a silver or gold crown. If the chat is IRC based, then the software should only allow access to IRC channels which conform with the above rules.</li>
		<li>We ask our players to be aware that there is dangerous software available that won't necessarily be spotted by their anti-virus software.</li>

<div class="container-divider container-divider--wider" style="margin-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;">
	<h2 class="double-title" style="font-size:3em;"><a name="rwt"></a>Real World Trading</h2>
	<div style="border: 2px solid black;outline: 1px solid #62686c;box-shadow:0px 0px 10px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.7);padding: 10px;background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7);margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 40px;">
		<p>Game items must only be exchanged for other items/services within the game.</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Real World Trading explained</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Real-world trading is the term used for activities which occur outside of the game environment which result in the real-world sale or purchase of items, GP or services with the intention of supplying or advancing a Jagex in-game character other than by the means that are incorporated into the game.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">This includes, but is not limited to: purchasing gold or items for RuneScape on 3rd party websites, buying a RuneScape account on 3rd party websites, paying someone to increase your account's experience (XP) and paying someone to complete quests and activities on your behalf.</p>
	<h4>Why we have this rule</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Nobody has our permission to sell RuneScape accounts or any RuneScape related virtual in-game item. All RuneScape accounts and virtual items are the property of Jagex Ltd and players are only granted a limited, revocable permission to use accounts and virtual items.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">The activities of people obtaining items with the intent of selling them, often involves cheating practices such as using macro scripts (botting).</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">When a player purchases an existing RuneScape account, there is a high probability that the account may have been stolen. Stolen accounts will always be returned to the original owner.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">For another player to use your game character they will require access to your account. This means your security becomes compromised and the account as well as the virtual items on the account, are then likely to be sold on to a third party.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">When items in RuneScape are not supplied by Jagex Ltd., the items are often taken from stolen accounts.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Any attempt to real world trade is a serious breach of a player's agreement with Jagex. Jagex does not recognise any attempted transfer of accounts or virtual items outside of the game environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="container-divider container-divider--wider" style="margin-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;">
	<h2 class="double-title" style="font-size:3em;"><a name="acc_sharing"></a>Account sharing and buying or selling accounts</h2>
	<div style="border: 2px solid black;outline: 1px solid #62686c;box-shadow:0px 0px 10px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.7);padding: 10px;background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7);margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 40px;">
		<p>Each account should only be used by one person. Never share your account with anyone else, doing so will likely get the account banned. Players may not sell, share, transfer or lend their account to anyone else. Players should not accept an account that anybody else offers, as they may be stolen, and this could lead to your own account being disabled!</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Why we have this rule</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">We have this rule as part of our procedures to preserve the integrity of the game and its players' hard earned achievements. The hiscores are there to measure the achievement of an individual, not a group of players or 3rd party. Also, if disputes occur or friendships breakdown, it can lead to at least one of the parties permanently losing access to the account or having it stripped of wealth and items.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Additionally, many of the accounts on sale are stolen, and people who share accounts run the risk that the person using the account won't give it back, or that the person will break a game rule causing the account to be banned or muted for which the account creator will be accountable.</p>
</div>
<div class="container-divider container-divider--wider" style="margin-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;">
	<h2 class="double-title" style="font-size:3em;"><a name="multi-logging"></a>Multiple logging-in</h2>
	<div style="border: 2px solid black;outline: 1px solid #62686c;box-shadow:0px 0px 10px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.7);padding: 10px;background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7);margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 40px;">
		<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">You are free to create as many accounts as you like and you are welcome to trade between your accounts just as you would with any other legitimate player.</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">However, if any of your accounts obtained wealth by rule breaking activity for example macro use (botting) or real world trading (buying gold or items from 3rd parties) then all your accounts will be banned.</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Similarly, multi-logged accounts must not interact with each other to exploit gameplay mechanics, such as attempting to rig the result of a minigame.</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Trading wealth or items between your own accounts is done entirely at your own risk. Unconventional trade methods like drop-, death- or trust-trades are particularly risky and we strongly advise against them.</p>
		<p>You may log into multiple accounts across all versions of RuneScape at the same time. However, any account you are using must not be involved in any rule breaking or exploitative activity. Any penalties or sanction for such behaviour will be applied to all of your accounts.</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Why we have this rule</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">We have this rule as part of our procedures to monitor and deal with people who choose to real world trade, gold farm and use macros. People who move wealth between accounts they own and have gained that wealth unfairly or by breaking other game rules can expect to be banned.</p>
</div>
<div class="container-divider container-divider--wider" style="margin-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;">
	<h2 class="double-title" style="font-size:3em;"><a name="bugabuse"></a>Knowingly exploiting a bug</h2>
	<div style="border: 2px solid black;outline: 1px solid #62686c;box-shadow:0px 0px 10px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.7);padding: 10px;background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7);margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 40px;">
		<p>Players must not use or attempt to use any cheats or errors which they may find in our software. Any exploits a player finds must be immediately reported to Jagex through Customer Support.</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Why we have this rule</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">We put a lot of effort into balancing our games to make them as fair and fun as possible. Bugs can spoil the effect of a game, so we obviously want to fix them as quickly as possible. Deliberately taking advantage of a bug can unbalance the game and devalue other players' efforts.</p>
	<h4>Finding bugs</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">If you find a bug, then <strong>report it to us immediately</strong> and do not divulge the nature of the issue to any other players. Players won't be penalised for experiencing a bug unless they use it to their advantage or advertise the nature of the issue to other players.</p>
	<h4>Reporting bugs</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">To submit a bug about the game, click the 'Report an issue' button on the All Chat interface. It brings up the reporting window, allowing you to report players who are in breach of the Rules of RuneScape. For more detailed instructions, see Report a Bug.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">To submit a bug report about one of our website features, select Submit a Bug Report at the top of this page. You will then be asked to select the area of the game you believe to be affected by the bug and then given information on currently known issues and issues which are often mistaken for bugs. We encourage you to read through these to avoid making duplicate reports.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">When filling out either of our bug report forms, please make sure you include as much detail as possible. This will help us find the bug and fix it as soon as possible. After the form has been filled out, it will be sent to a member of Jagex staff to investigate.</p>
	<h4>Cheats for Jagex games</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">There are no cheat codes available for any of our games, nor do we have any intention of adding them. All gains have to be made fairly through honest game play. Any usage of cheats or bugs - or attempting to discover the existence of any cheats or bugs - is a direct violation of our rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="container-divider container-divider--wider" style="margin-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;">

		<p>Players must not attempt to impersonate Jagex staff in any way, for any reason.</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Why we have this rule</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">We have this rule in place so our players can identify members of Jagex staff, thus ensuring that players can trust members of our staff for help and support with any game related problems they may have.</p>
	<h4>Identifying Jagex staff</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Jagex staff have a gold crown next to their name when speaking in-game. Anyone who does not have a gold crown next to their name is not Jagex staff. This applies to both private chat and general, in-game chat.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Don't listen to the rumours! We have no 'undercover' staff, we have no need for your password to check your account and we only communicate with players about account issues via their in-game message centre.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">If you ever see anyone attempting to impersonate a Jagex Staff member or any other player, we suggest that you ignore their request and add them to your Ignore List.</p>
	<h4>Players with silver crowns</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">The players that have silver crowns by their names when speaking in-game are Player Moderators. Anyone that does not have a silver crown next to their name is not a Player Moderator. Player Mods are not employed by Jagex, but are players who have shown great maturity and community spirit, and as such have been given some extra responsibility in game. Player Moderators do not have the ability to ban accounts and must abide by the same rules as all other players.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Player Mods are chosen at our discretion. We will only recruit Player Mods via the in-game message centre and we will never offer Player Moderator status within the game itself.</p>

	<div style="border: 2px solid black;outline: 1px solid #62686c;box-shadow:0px 0px 10px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.7);padding: 10px;background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7);margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 40px;">
		<p>Asking/trying to persuade another player to give you their password or bank PIN for any reason is against the rules and will not be tolerated. Players must not scam or deceive other players.</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Why we have this rule</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Misleading other players for your own personal gain is not in the spirit of fair play. This rule is in place to protect our players' accounts. As 'Account Sharing' is not permitted there is no reason why there would be a need to request another player's password.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">An 'item scam' is an attempt to obtain GP and/or items from another player by dishonest means.</p>

	<h2 class="double-title" style="font-size:3em;"><a name="games-of-chance"></a>Unofficial Player Run Games of Chance</h2>
	<div style="border: 2px solid black;outline: 1px solid #62686c;box-shadow:0px 0px 10px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.7);padding: 10px;background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7);margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 40px;">
		<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">You must not advertise, organise, promote, or take part in any unofficial player run games of chance where in-game money or items are staked on the outcome of a random in-game activity. This includes, but is not limited to, all types of chance games where players trade an amount of in game money or items with the expectation that they will receive in game money or items in return based on the outcome of a game of chance or similar activity.</p>
		<p>It is also against the rules to bet on the outcome of another player's activities within the game, for example: how long it will take to kill a monster, or the outcome of a duel (commonly referred to as "commission staking").</p>

		</div>
	<h4>Why we have this rule</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">This rule is in place to protect people who have worked hard for their in game wealth and to make sure that they don't fall foul of scams run by unscrupulous players.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Even if a player does intend to complete the promised transaction, it is often the case that the rules of the chosen game of chance are not clear, or the game of chance being played is not fair and heavily stacked in the favour of one particular side.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">In addition, players who promote and offer trust trades often spam the chat window making it hard for regular players to enjoy the social experience of game play, carry out legitimate trading and enjoy the busy communal areas of the game as intended.</p>

	<h2 class="double-title" style="font-size:3em;"><a name="encouragingrulebreaking"></a>Encouraging others to break the rules</h2>
	<div style="border: 2px solid black;outline: 1px solid #62686c;box-shadow:0px 0px 10px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.7);padding: 10px;background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7);margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 40px;">
		<p>You must not encourage or help others to break any of the Rules of Conduct.</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Why we have this rule</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Encouraging or helping others to break the rules is as bad as breaking them yourself, and therefore anyone doing so will be treated as if they were the one breaking the rule.</p>
	<h4>Examples</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Attempting to convince other players that the Rules of Conduct are different from what they actually are.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Creating, distributing or advertising third-party add-ons that break our third-party software rule.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Advertising or linking to real-world trading websites.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Encouraging others to abuse bugs - any bugs found should be reported to Jagex immediately.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Hosting, facilitating, linking to, or providing software which links to, forums/chat where users discuss behaviour which breaks rules, or help or encourage each other to do so (unless a genuine effort is made to moderate such chat and prevent such discussion).</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Jagex staff will use their own discretion in ascertaining whether an individual or individuals are encouraging other to violate our rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="container-divider container-divider--wider" style="margin-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;">
	<h2 class="double-title" style="font-size:3em;"><a name="offensive-lang"></a>Inappropriate language or behaviour</h2>
	<div style="border: 2px solid black;outline: 1px solid #62686c;box-shadow:0px 0px 10px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.7);padding: 10px;background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7);margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 40px;">
		<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Players of RuneScape come from all around the world and from a range cultural and religious backgrounds. Our mission is to create a fun and engaging game for all our players, therefore language that is considered offensive, racist, obscene or otherwise inappropriate should not be used in chat or as a username.</p>
		<p>We encourage players that experience language they deem to be offensive to use their Ignore List and chat filters to customise their experience.</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Why we have this rule</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">We have this rule to ensure that any and all players can have the best experience possible.</p>
	<h4>Inappropriate language</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">This includes (but is not limited to): discussion of recreational drugs, sexually explicit language, solicitation, racism or other prejudice, threatening behaviour, blackmail and excessive swearing.</p>
	<h4>Solicitation</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">It is not okay to ask for a boyfriend or girlfriend in-game. This is not a dating website after all!</p>
	<h4>Spam</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Spamming/flooding the chat window is to fill the chat window with unnecessary text. Players should refrain from spamming, as it can be detrimental to others enjoyment of the in game chat systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="container-divider container-divider--wider" style="margin-top: 20px;padding-bottom: 20px;">
	<h2 class="double-title" style="font-size:3em;"><a name="personal-details"></a>Asking for or providing contact information</h2>
	<div style="border: 2px solid black;outline: 1px solid #62686c;box-shadow:0px 0px 10px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.7);padding: 10px;background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7);margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 40px;">
		<p>For privacy and safety, players must not ask for personal details such as full name, email address, instant messenger handles, telephone number, home/school address or age. Players also must not post anyone's personal contact details (including their own) on our in-game chat or forums.</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Why we have this rule</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">We have this rule in place to protect player privacy and ensure a safe in game environment. Giving out personal details may affect the security of a player's account as well as a player's own personal safety. When interacting with others online, it is common sense to never divulge personal information, both for players' personal safety as well as account safety.</p>
	<h4>Personal details</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Personal details are considered to include full name, email addresses, instant messenger screen names/contact details, telephone numbers, a player's home/school address or age.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h2 class="double-title" style="font-size:3em;"><a name="web-advertising"></a>Advertising other websites</h2>
	<div style="border: 2px solid black;outline: 1px solid #62686c;box-shadow:0px 0px 10px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.7);padding: 10px;background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7);margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 40px;">
		<p>Players should refrain from actively advertising in any of our games or forums. This includes advertising any website or product. To protect all our players we have made the decision that no web addresses are allowed to be linked on our games.</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Why we have this rule</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Links to sites can sometimes be dangerous to players (by leading to sites with inappropriate content) accounts (by leading the owner to phishing websites designed to capture their account details) or to a player's computer (by downloading a virus when they go to the site). This precaution has been taken in order that no links to any sites may be advertised in-game or in the Forums, thereby protecting players and their computers.</p>
	<h4>Messenger program IDs / channels</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Any link has the potential to be misleading and cause a player to either compromise the security of their account, computer or their personal safety. For this reason, players may not post links of this nature.</p>
	<h4>Fan sites and clan sites</h4>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Giving out the URL/link for a clan site could still pose a potential security risk for the player. This rule is in place to as a preventative action to ensure all 100% of our community is having a safe and fun experience in RuneScape.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:15px;">Fan sites are an excellent contributing factor to the RuneScape experience. To ensure the safety and satisfaction of all our player please see the below requirements:</p>
	<ul style="font-size: 1.5em;list-style-type: disc;padding-left: 20px;line-height: 1.5em; padding-bottom: 15px;">
